Junior Full Stack Engineer -Assignment 
Overview 
Time Limit: 1-3 working days 
Objective: Build a well-structured full-stack application that demonstrates your understanding of TypeScript, modular architecture, services, APIs, authentication, caching, and Docker. 
You are free to choose the application domain and title. The focus is not on the idea itself, but on how you design and implement modules, services, and infrastructure. 
Project Scope (Open Choice) 
You may build any meaningful application 
• Any CRUD-based system with real-world behavior 
Note: Application name and UI complexity are not important. Code quality, architecture, and correctness are critical. 
Mandatory Technology Stack 
Frontend 
• 
Framework: React or Next.js 
Language: TypeScript (mandatory) 
Styling: Tailwind CSS/Shadcn/CSS Modules / styled-components 
State Management: Context API or any state management library 
API Communication: Fetch / Axios (REST) or Apollo Client (GraphQL) React Query Requirements: 
Backend 
О Form validation 
O Loading & error states 
Protected routes 
Responsive UI (mobile friendly) 
Framework: Node.js or NestJS (TypeScript mandatory) 
• 
API Type: REST or GraphQL (GraphQL preferred) 
Authentication: JWT-based authentication 
Authorization: Role-based access control 
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB 
ORM/ODM: TypeORM (PostgreSQL) or Mongoose (MongoDB) Validation: class-validator & class-transformer 
Caching: Redis or in-memory caching (mandatory) 
DevOps 
Docker 
Docker Compose 
Git (clear and meaningful commit history) 
Mandatory Functional Requirements 
1. Authentication & Authorization 
User registration (email + password) User login with JWT token generation Protected routes (frontend & backend) Role-based access control 
Logout functionality 
2. Core Domain Module (Your Choice) 
Implement at least one main domain module relevant to your application. 
Must include: 
Create 
Read (with pagination) 
Update 
Delete 
Filtering and/or search 
Ownership or role-based permissions 
(e.g., only creator or admin can delete) 
3. User Management 
View list of users 
Assign or relate users to domain entities View user-specific data 
(e.g., items created or assigned) 
4. Dashboard / Summary View 
Create a simple dashboard that displays: 
Total records 
Records grouped by status or type Records related to the logged-in user 
Charts/graphs are optional but encouraged. 
5. Filtering & Search 
Filter data by status or category 
Filter by related user 
Search by text fields (title, description, etc.) 
Caching (Mandatory) 
Your backend must implement caching to improve performance. 
Requirements 
Use Redis or in-memory cache 
Cache read-heavy endpoints, such as: 
О List endpoints 
Dashboard/statistics endpoints 
Implement cache invalidation on: 
Create 
O Update 
О 
Delete 
Expectations 
Proper cache key design 
TTL (Time-To-Live) usage 
Clear separation between business logic and cache handling Environment-based cache configuration 
Backend Architecture Expectations 
Your backend must demonstrate: 
Clear module separation (Auth, Users, Core Domain) Services containing business logic 
DTO-based validation 
Guards for authentication & authorization 
Centralized error handling 
Environment-based configuration 
Logging (console logs acceptable) 
Testing Requirements 
Provide at least 3 unit tests, including: 
Authentication or authorization logic 
Core domain service 
Cache behavior or cache invalidation 
Database Requirements 
Proper schema design 
Entity relationships 
Indexes for frequently queried fields 
Migrations (required for SQL databases) 
Docker Requirements 
Provide the following: 
Dockerfile for backend 
Dockerfile for frontend 
docker-compose.yml including: 
Backend service 
O Frontend service 
୦ 
Database service 
Cache service (Redis if used) 
The application must run using: 
docker-compose up 
Bonus Features (Optional) 
Both REST and GraphQL APIs Refresh token mechanism 
WebSockets / real-time updates 
File uploads 
Email notifications 
Swagger (REST) or GraphQL Playground 
CI/CD pipeline 
Cloud deployment 
Additional domain modules 
Deliverables 
1. Source Code 
• Public GitHub repository 
• Clean, readable code 
• Meaningful commit messages .env.example file 
No secrets committed 
2. README.md (Very Important) 
Must include: 
• Project overview 
• Technology stack Architecture overview 
Folder structure explanation Database schema diagram 
API documentation 
Setup instructions (Docker & local) 
Design decisions & trade-offs 
Known limitations 
Future improvements 
Screenshots (optional but recommended)
